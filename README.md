### Joke

Thanks to McGraw Hill for inspiring this project by making textbooks so tedious that even llama couldn't read them. Fun fact: Llama is a type of camelid, and McGraw Hill textbooks are often referred to as "camel" books because they can be a bit of a "hump" to get through. So, in a way, this project is like giving a llama a break from all that heavy lifting! Lol, get it? Llama, camel, books... ok, I'll stop now.

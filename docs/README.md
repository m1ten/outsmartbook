# Smarterbook Shutdown Notice

**Q:** Why can't I find Smarterbook on the Chrome Web Store?

**A:** I recieved a [cease and desist](https://x.com/micahtlindley/status/1756092888566358403) letter from McGraw Hill and was forced to remove the extension in two days or less..  
<br />

**Q:** Why didn't you fight the cease and desist in court?

**A:** This is the same law firm that represents Sony and Universal Music, and I am a college kid with a minimum wage job.  I can't afford legal fees even though I feel like I rightfully should not have to comply with their cease-and-desist letter.  
<br />

**Q:** Why is Smarterbook no longer functioning on my computer?

**A:** After removing the extension from the Chrome Web Store, I was instructed that I had to remove all functionality from existing users.  The only way to do this was to roll out an update that intentionally broke the extension.  
<br />

**Q:** Will Smarterbook ever come back?

**A:** Almost certainly not.  It was a side project I made in a single day, and I can't afford any legal troubles that come with messing about with McGraw Hill.  
<br />

**Q:** Do you make things other than Smarterbook?

**A:** Yes!  I've made some pretty cool things on the Internet besides Smarterbook, and I'd love for you to keep up with me via [my website](https://micahlindley.com).
